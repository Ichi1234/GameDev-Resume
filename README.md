# Game Developer Portfolio & Distribution Platform

## Project Description

This project is a Full-Stack Web Application designed as a personal **Game Developer Portfolio and Project Distribution Platform**.

The system allows the developer (system owner) to manage portfolio content including:

- Game projects
- Project descriptions
- Media assets (images/videos)
- Technologies used
- Contact information

It also allows external users such as HR or players to:

- View portfolio content
- Submit contact requests

This project demonstrates implementation of:

- Multi-user role system
- Authentication & authorization
- Full CRUD database operations
- Layered system architecture
- Secure backend design



# Problem Statement

- Showcase projects professionally
- Manage portfolio content efficiently
- Allow recruiters to contact them easily

This system provides:

- Structured portfolio management
- Role-based access control
- Clean and scalable architecture

# System Architecture Overview

This project follows a 3-Tier Layered Architecture:

Presentation Layer  → Next.js (Frontend)  
Application Layer   → FastAPI (Backend API)  
Data Layer          → SQLite (Database)


## Presentation Layer (Frontend)

- Built with Next.js
- Handles UI rendering
- Sends API requests to backend
- Role-based content rendering


## Application Layer (Backend)

- Built with FastAPI
- Handles:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Business logic
  - API routing
  - Input validation
- Implements JWT-based authentication


## Data Layer

- SQLite database
- Stores:
  - Users
  - Roles
  - Permissions
  - Games
  - Contact messages


# Architecture Characteristics

This system emphasizes:

- Separation of Concerns
- Modularity
- Scalability
- Security
- Maintainability
- Low deployment complexity


# Database Design

Main Tables:

- users
- roles
- permissions
- games


Relationships:

- One user has one role
- One role has multiple permissions
- Games are managed by Developer


# Authentication & Authorization

The system implements:

- Secure login & logout
- Password hashing
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based access control
- Protected API endpoints
- Permission-based route guarding


# Technology Stack

## Frontend
- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Backend
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- Pydantic
- JWT Authentication

## Database
- SQLite
